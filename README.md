#Hangman

This project is an app that creates a game of hangman in your web browser. The project was made to learn Sinatra through the [Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/sinatra-project). The game was coded in Ruby and developed as an app with Sinatra.  

The object of the game is to discover the secret word by guessing one letter at a time. Incorrect letters reveal part of the hangman, and if all of the hangman's parts are revealed, the player loses.

The app is hosted on [Heroku](http://langenfeld-hangman.herokuapp.com/).
